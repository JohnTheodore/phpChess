php chess.php; // to run the game

*Yes I know php is for server side scripting and doesn't make a good language for a chess engine. This isn't a chess engine, I am just implementing the rules for chess. The point is to learn and get better at php/OOP concepts. I'll use stockfish written in c++ for the engine.

++TODO
* I'll need unit tests, php units tests look crappy compared to rspec.
* Validate all the pieces
* castling/en passant
* check
* checkmate
* filter user input more so they can throw in garbage
