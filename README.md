php chess.php; // to run the game

*Yes I know php is for server side scripting and doesn't make a good language for a chess engine. This isn't a chess engine, I am just implementing the rules for chess. The point is to learn and get better at php/OOP concepts. I'll use stockfish written in c++ for the engine.
